### Notes

    * Usage JIRA to insert tickets -> "Preservation: Bla bla something"

### Ideas

    * Depends on the type of file (software, publication, image, etc)
    * Probably have some hashmap/list w/ research type vs file types
    * Have categories such as Openness, proprietary, etc.
    * Extensions first, uso FIDO to validate
    * Most frequent formats on DB ?
